# SolvingAlgorithms
Hi everyone!
In this repository, i compared the speed of sorting arrays of numbers using Bubble method and Insertion method.
I also created a custom implementation of the LinkedList methods Insert (head, tail, and by index), Delete (head, tail, and by index), Get all list items, and Get item by index.
I started to create custom implementation binary tree, so far I have only created the output of all the elements of the tree, 
and also created a Node class that contains the data of the binary tree node.
